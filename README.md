# My-Developer-Portfolio
This is my first developer portfolio, showcasing what I have learned in HTML and CSS. I will be updating the portfolio as I develop my skills in other coding languages.

This is a very basic webpage allowing me to explore all of the elements and properties accessible in HTML and CSS.

All code was created and edited by me.
The image backstage at the festival Riot Fest was taken by me.
The second image of Pad Thai was used thanks to lemonblossoms.com
